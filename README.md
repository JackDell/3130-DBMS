The project folder in this repo contains the four files mentioned in the Project document provided by Dr. Kiringa in his earlier email.
The project is a group project with a max of 4 members. On completing the project you can present it to the lab TA's and then send it
as an email to your lab TA for final evaluation. 

Imp: The Project Setup.pdf file in the Project folder has the list of steps on how you can setup the project in Windows 10.
	 For Mac / Linux users you can use steps 2 - 6 and for step 8 you can simply edit the files as you normally would.
